This is however a fun project for me and Hadyen and may be slowly developed.

FUTURE IDEAS:
    ECONOMY MODULE, LEVELLING MODULE, SHOP, EMBEDS & INTERACTIVE EMBEDS, BUTTON MENU WITH HELP, OPTIMISATION, MUSIC, PREFIX CHANGE COMMAND & MORE

V1.1 MillerBot - NextCord
-19/08/2022
-  Moved too NextCord restarting all learning and development
-  [Hayden Mak](https://github.com/haydenmlh) began helping with Miller Bot Development
-  Joint project
  Basic commands remade (!!kick, !!ban, !!lick, !!ping) all with validation to ensure no crashing and specific targets can access these commands
  Cog folder (fun.py, help.py, staff.py, utils.py) to help clean up the code and can be toggled by me or asimulator
      This allows for modules to be edited without having to restart the bot (!!reload, !!load, !!unload)

V1 MillerBot - Discordpy
- 16/08/2022
- New to discordpy
- Created in discord.py
- Had issues with buttons on embeds and discovered is it being discontinued
- Very basic commands
  (!kick, !ban, !help etc), No validation so crashers were common
  Only just got embeds working
  Very messy code
